- network sometimes gives negative position in underlying
    -> can this ever make sense? / quick fix would be ReLU in final layer

- in training: could use true price or bs price
    is bs price is correct; should get market price back from implied vola?!
    check how optionmetrics calculates this

- Or go back to also learning the price
    this could make sense: It is essentially the starting capital in the hedge portfolio

- Do normalization
